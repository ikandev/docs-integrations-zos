[[_id1695df0d0lg]]
= Copy Sources to PDS for compilation

== Purpose

This is a mandatory z/OS Phase.

This Phase copies the object types (specified in the properties files) from the Target location on the IKAN ALM Agent into temporary PDSs on the z/OS Platform.
Before the file transfers, temporary PDSs will be created, as well as the PDSs necessary for compiling the files selected in the next Phase.

== Usage

The _Copy Sources Before Compilation_ Phase can be used on Build and Deploy Environments.

This Phase is dependent on the <<CopyFromSourceTarget.adoc#_id1695k0k0ijd,Copy from Source to Target>> Phase.

* On the __Build Environment__, this Phase is mandatory. This phase is used in combination with the two other two mandatory Build phases. It must follow the _Copy from Source to Target_ Phase and precede the _Maps and Programs compilation_ Phase.
* On the __Deploy Environment__, this Phase is optional.
